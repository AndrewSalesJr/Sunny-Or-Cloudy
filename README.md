## Project Overview
Sunny-Or-Cloudy is a project in which I must create a page for tourists who wish to check the current and near future weather of areas they wish to visit.

In this project, I will need to start coding from scratch to create a "Weather Dashboard" that allows users to search for specific cities to see the weather there and store those searched cities locally so that they can be easily returned to. To do this I will need to rely on the server side API known as the OpenWeather One Call API. I will also be using bootstrap and JQuery to ease up on the amount of coding I will need to write.

## Appearance and Functionality
Open opening the site, users will see the basic layout of the page with labels so that they may know where to expect the information to be located. After entering and city or state into the search bar and pressing "Search", the labels will be replaced with the proper weather information based on the location they chose. They will also be shown the 5 day forecast under the  weather for the current date. The name of location they search will be stored locally on their device and appear to the left of the forecast. They should stay there even upon reloading the page. Lastly if they are to click on the the name of the stored location it should bring up its weather information again.
